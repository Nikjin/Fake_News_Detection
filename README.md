In this Project, I trained a Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM based deep learning model to detect fake news from a given news corpus.

I walk through following steps:

1. Import libraries and datasets
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Perform Data Cleaning
4. Visualize the cleaned data
5. Prepare the data by tokenizing and padding
6. Build and train the model using LSTM and RNN
7. Assess trained model performance
